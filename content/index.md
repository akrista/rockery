Hello! I'm Jorge Thomas (akrista), and this is my digital **[rockery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_garden)** - a personal space where I cultivate ideas, thoughts, and knowledge on solid foundations.

## 🔮 Why "Rockery"?

A **rockery** is a garden built on stones that thrives in challenging conditions. Like a traditional rock garden, my digital space is built on solid foundations using:

- **🔹 Obsidian** - For creating interconnected notes
- **💎 Quartz** - For transforming notes into this beautiful website
- **🏗️ Solid principles** - Durable, interconnected, and resilient ideas

## 🌱 What You'll Find Here

This is my space for **[learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)** 📖:

- **📝 Personal notes** - Thoughts in progress, learning notes, and reflections
- **🔗 Interconnected ideas** - Concepts that link and build upon each other
- **🛠️ Work in progress** - Drafts, experiments, and evolving thoughts

## 🗺️ How to Explore

- **🔍 Search** for specific topics
- **🕸️ Graph view** to visualize connections
- **📑 Tags** to browse by themes
- **🔗 Links** to follow idea trails
